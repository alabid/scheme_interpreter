BUGS WE NEED TO FIX
====================
1. Newline issue:
   On the tokenizer homework, the symbol-integer issue he was referring to
   was because he did not terminate his test files with a newline.
   We need to fix this enabling the tests to pass on EOF not just newline.
   
-- I'm not sure whether I fixed that. I added EOF to the tokenize
   function. Please check.
	  
PART 2
======
1. When reading a file, if it encounters a bug, it doesn't
 end the program but continues executing the codes. This could
 sometimes lead to seg. fault if another function is
 dependent on the result.

 --- specific examples? Probably before we modified the parse tree
     which could cause some problems. After I made changes, please
     check again.

2. >= and <=
 does not compare 5.5 with 5.50 well. Probably Yichen can look at
 Daniel's arithmeticEqual function who handles such cases well.

3.
