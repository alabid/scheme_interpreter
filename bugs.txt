BUGS WE NEED TO FIX
====================
1. Newline issue:
   On the tokenizer homework, the symbol-integer issue he was referring to
   was because he did not terminate his test files with a newline.
   We need to fix this enabling the tests to pass on EOF not just newline.
   
-- I'm not sure whether I fixed that. I added EOF to the tokenize
   function. Please check.
	  
PART 2
======
1. When reading a file, if it encounters a bug, it doesn't
 end the program but continues executing the codes. This could
 sometimes lead to seg. fault if another function is
 dependent on the result.

 --- specific examples? Probably before we modified the parse tree
     which could cause some problems. After I made changes, please
     check again.



4. Bugs in input more than one functions in the same line. Can be
fixed if we change parser, I guess.


6. We should be not able to eval the following, but now it gives #f.

(letrec ((even2?
          (lambda (x)
            (or (= x 0)
                (odd2? (- x 1)))))
         (odd2?
          (lambda (x)
            (and (not (= x 0))
                 (even2? (- x 1))))))
  (even2? 20))


7. (let ((y 0)) (set! x 10) (set! y 10) (+ x y)) => shoud be 20. Now
error message.
