BUGS WE NEED TO FIX
====================
1. Newline issue:
   On the tokenizer homework, the symbol-integer issue he was referring to
   was because he did not terminate his test files with a newline.
   We need to fix this enabling the tests to pass on EOF not just newline.
   
2. We cannot handle execution of closures and functions well.
   eg. ((lambda (x) x)) does not produce the correct result.
   -- Now it can handle cases like:
      	  ((lambda () (+ 5 ((lambda () (+ ((lambda () 5)) 5))))))  =>15
	  

3. letrec should evaluate things simutaneously.
   (letrec ((x y) (y 5)) x)  => 5 but now it throws an error.

4. car/cdr do not work well.
     (car (quote (5 6)))   => 5 but now it gives a segmentation fault.


   
5. MEMOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRYYYYYYYYYYY LLLLLLLLLLLEAAAAAAAAAKKKKKKKKK!!
