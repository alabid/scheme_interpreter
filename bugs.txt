BUGS WE NEED TO FIX
====================
1. Newline issue:
   On the tokenizer homework, the symbol-integer issue he was referring to
   was because he did not terminate his test files with a newline.
   We need to fix this enabling the tests to pass on EOF not just newline.
2. (if () 2 3) evals to 3 but it should eval to 3 according to
drracket. 
	  -- I think it is now fixed.
3. (45) should give an error but it instead gives 45. 
     -- I think now it prints an error message, but still prints out
     weird parens.
4. (if () 2 3) now produces some error because of an assertion:
   args != ((void *) 0)
    -- Maybe not.

--Because we probably want to interact with the users later, we should
  allow users to enter a number without parens. Unless we do something
  fancy, we probably need parens back and I changed them back.
