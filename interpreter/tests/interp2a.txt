We implemented let*, and, or, set!, cond
We also implemented arithmetic operations, +, -, *, /, <=, >=, =.
We tried to free everything we can.


We are still working on the following functions that are not part of 2a:
cons, car, cdr and equal?
We haven't finished them yet and we know our cons, car, cdr do not deal with improper list.
